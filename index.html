            Trapped in a fever dream fusion of Jodorosky's The Mountain and Martyrs, Caging The Gods is a gruesome metaphor that questions the difference between insanity and faith, sadism and mercy. A miracle and a curse.
            <br><br>
            On the night of Xalo's star, an astrological event awaited by Herbert Welsch and his followers (The Star of Xalo), a suicide ritual consecrates the summoning of an intergalactic being.
            Upon the ritual's completion a UFO crash lands near the Jonestown-eque compound and Herbert rushes to find an alien lying near death in the crashed vessel. Herbert is quick to usher the arrived guest into his compound and nursesthe being back to health. Coming to, the alien is informed his name is Xalo and he is the long awaited Messiah who will guide the cult into a new era of civilization, Xalo the Son of the Stars. Unable to communicate or understand what is happening, Xalo is suddenly taken to be worshipped by the followers as proof of Herbert's prophecies. At the mercy of their care Xalo is used as a prop to further validate Herbert's escalating delusions of grandeur. A new era of existence will be ushered in by the immersion of flesh and stars, a child will be born. Drugged and abused, Xalo is forced to copulate with Herbert's daughter Myra who not only seeks to fulfill the prophecy but to beseech her father's power. Despite Xalo's screams, Myra is impregnated only to die in childbirth of her mutant son. Angered by his daughter's death and seeing it as a betrayal by Xalo, Herbert kills the star-borne offspring and declares Xalo not a messiah but 'The Anti-Life.' In fear of their unwitting kickstart to the now impending apocalypse that Herbert preaches, Xalo is then crucified. As Xalo lays bleeding out upon a cross and looking up at the stars, he wonders how it is he got here and pleads for help. Suddenly three Cosmic Elders appear having finally heard his calls. They offer to bring him home, but something has changed in Xalo. What was confused, helpless and lost has now become callous and Xalo no longer seeks escape but revenge.

            Herschel’s Hill is a slasher-with-a-gun focused on mature character dynamics and themes that heighten brutal slasher fanfare. In a blend of Jacob’s Ladder and Friday The 13th, Herschell’s Hill follows a group of soldiers under fire from an undead maniac sniper who terrorizes a local hiking trail.

            Amanda McKinley is a sergeant in the U.S Army Corp returned from Afghanistan and accompanied by her squadmates Brady (her boyfriend) and Knox (his buddy). To reunite with her sister, Sarah, Amanda agrees to take a hiking trip up to her recently deceased father's cabin to spread his ashes. Problems arise when they lose their bearings and stumble into a haunted area called Herschell’s Hill--a place that locals have avoided since the early 1900’s when a murdered boy named Herschell came back from the dead to kill all the townsfolk. Amanda takes charge to get them back on track and up to the cabin, but it feels off. Besides things being out of place, mysterious notes are discovered in her father's journal, which convinces Sarah that her dad had not killed himself, but was murdered. Amanda dismisses her overly emotional sister’s worries--that is until she gets pinned down by sniper fire. From here, Amanda does her best to lead her troop through the forest and out to safety. However, this is Herschell’s Hill and his aim is true. Amanda’s strength is tested as Herschell picks off her troop one by one and captures her, where she realizes that Herschell’s objective isn’t just to kill but to take the child growing in her womb.

            A horror destination experience akin to The Blair Witch Project meets Project X with a vibrant concert experience that becomes the hunting grounds of a group of cultists and their A.I figurehead known as The Father. Kenneth Stranger is the host of America Makes Weird, a podcast dedicated to discovering the strangeness of our own realities but lacks a serious viewer count to qualify on any radar. In hopes of finding his break through episode Kenneth accompanies his friends to a Burning Man-esque spring break festival and along the way pick up a hitchhiker named Zarathustra. She tells them something big is awaiting them at the festival and reveals she belongs to a spiritual movement called the Neologians. Immediately captivated by her, Kenneth splits his time between drug induced follies with friends and pursuing Zarathustra for an interview for his show. She agrees to not only interview but introduce Kenneth into the Neologian and meet the one they call Father. As Kenneth records, he is drawn into a much larger occult conspiracy at play as Zarathustra tells him he will be “The Witness” to The Great Upload, a mass-death ritual to be carried out upon the unsuspecting patrons of the spring break music festival. If only Kenneth hadn’t gotten so close, he may be able to save both his friends and possibly the world...
